	The ceremony and reception are in Gaithersburg, Maryland.  Without traffic, it is less than an hour from Washington, DC.  For out of town guests, we recommend flying into Dulles or National airport or getting into Union Station by train/bus.  Dulles is the closer of the two airports.
	<p>
	If you fly into National or are coming into Union Station, you can take the Metro into Gaithersburg. You will need to call a taxi to get around Gaithersburg though. The hotel is 4 miles from the <a href="http://www.wmata.com/rail/station_detail.cfm?station_id=18">Shady Grove Metro</a> (Red Line).   
	<p>
	The hotel is the <a href="http://www.marriott.com/meeting-event-hotels/group-corporate-travel/groupCorp.mi?resLinkData=Crow/Goemaat%20Wedding%5Ewaswg%60cgwcgwa%60109%60USD%60false%605/3/14%605/5/14%604/11/14&app=resvlink&stop_mobi=yes">Gaithersburg Marriott Washingtonian Center</a>.  There is a group rate for Saturday and Sunday night. The group rate is only guaranteed up to April 11th. The hotel is about 5 miles from Smokey Glen Farm.  We are not planning on a shuttle between the hotel and the wedding, but the hotel can help arrange a ride if you are car-less.
